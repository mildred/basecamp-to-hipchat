Basecamp to HipChat Integration
===============================

This software is monitoring the Basecamp API and report any new events to
HipChat (event run while this program was running, it doesn't post past events
before the daemon started)

TODO
====

Switch to HipChat API v2 using https://github.com/tbruyelle/hipchat-go. The main
issue being that the APIv2 doesn't allow to set the From field for a
notification.

Hacking
=======

The dependencies are vendored. To vendor dependencies, just run:

    make deps

Docker Container
================

This program is designed to be run in a Docker container. To generate a Docker
image, run with sufficient permissions:

    make docker-image

If you want to create a debian package, you'll need to configure authnetication
settings. Just copy `config.mk.sample` to `config.mk` and update the variables
(Makefile syntax).

To create the package, run:

    make docker-package

To deploy it on a server, make sure the server details are set in `config.mk`
and run:

    make deploy
